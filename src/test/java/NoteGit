GIT CLASS 2
Clone the pr
-create new fold
-git clone “url”

Note: name sure terminal is in the right location, you have to go inside the folder
 or close the terminal and open it again in a new location (cd ls);

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, ANY STEP DO create a new branch!

create new brunch Git branch name;
switch the focus  to that brunch - git checkout name
check that we switched to the branch  - git branch, IntelliJ will show also that
you’re in correct branch in bottom right corner;
make commit on the brunch that you’re working with
then you can switch to main and see that the changes you made did not effect main
git push -u origin FeatureSun - will push your updated code to local repo from new brunch;
git stash -u - will delete all your changes and will bring back your last commit



Pull request is the request that lets everyone know that you’re done with code
 and it needs to be merged.
Go to pull requests -
-base brunch -main
compare- new one
create full request, add description, chose review and so.
merge
after merge, please switch to main and do git fetch - to see if there are any changes
git pull - update your code
you can only merge to the branches from which you branch out.






The operation of clone by default only clones main brunch, if you want to have
there brunches o git branch -a -lists all the branches on git hub
git checkout brunch name to download the branch from git hub



MERGING IN INTEL USING LOCAL GIT:
1 switch to the branch you want to merge to git checkout name
Git merge “name of the brunch you want to merge”
After resolving a conflict you MUST make a commit on the brunch in which you resolved
 conflict git add . Git commit -m”conflict"
4 after push everything to GitHub git push
